THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON
CHAPTER 1: THE BEGINNING

In the early hours of Sunday, 2 September 1666, a small fire broke out in the bakery of Thomas Farriner on Pudding Lane, near London Bridge. Farriner, the king's baker, had gone to bed leaving the fire in his oven still burning. Sparks from the oven ignited nearby fuel, and the flames quickly spread throughout the bakery.

The family was trapped upstairs but managed to escape through an upstairs window, though their maid, too afraid to attempt the escape, became the fire's first victim. By the time the neighbors noticed the flames, the fire had already taken hold of the bakery and was spreading to adjacent buildings.

Sir Thomas Bloodworth, the Lord Mayor of London, was awakened to be informed of the fire but infamously dismissed its severity, reportedly saying, "Pish! A woman might piss it out!" This dismissive attitude would prove catastrophic as the fire continued to spread unchecked.

Samuel Pepys, a naval administrator and diarist, recorded the events in his famous diary. He was awakened around 3 a.m. by his maid, who informed him of a great fire in the city. Initially, Pepys did not think much of it, but after seeing the growing flames from his window, he decided to investigate. He took a boat to the Tower of London and climbed to a high vantage point, from where he could see the fire consuming houses along the riverfront.

Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Pepys made his way to Whitehall to inform King Charles II and his brother, James, Duke of York, about the fire's severity. The king ordered Pepys to tell the Lord Mayor to pull down houses to create firebreaks, a common firefighting technique of the time.

However, Bloodworth hesitated to give such orders without the property owners' consent, fearing he would be held financially responsible for the destruction. This delay allowed the fire to grow even more intense, fed by the predominantly wooden buildings of London and a strong easterly wind.

By the end of that first day, the fire had already consumed 300 houses and several churches, including the church of St. Magnus-the-Martyr. The flames had jumped across streets and alleys, creating a wall of fire that moved westward from Pudding Lane toward the heart of the city.

The citizens of London, initially shocked by the rapid spread of the fire, began to flee with whatever possessions they could carry. The narrow streets became clogged with people and carts, making it difficult for firefighters to reach the affected areas. The Thames, which could have been a source of water for fighting the fire, was largely inaccessible due to the warehouses along its banks being among the first buildings to burn.

As night fell on that first day, the sky over London glowed an ominous red, visible for miles around. The Great Fire of London had only just begun its devastating march through the city, and the worst was yet to come.
